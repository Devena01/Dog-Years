// Human Age in Dog years//

// Step 1: Assigned the value 46 to the 'myAge' variable
var myAge = 46;
console.log(myAge);

// Steps 2 and 3: Assigned the value of 2 to the variable 'EarlyYears'
var earlyYears = 2;
console.log(earlyYears);

earlyYears *= 10.5;
console.log(earlyYears);

// Step 4: Subtracted early years (2) from total age (46) to calculate late years
var DifferenceOfMyAgeAndEarlyYears = 46 - 2;
console.log(DifferenceOfMyAgeAndEarlyYears);

//Step 5: Multiplied the 'laterYears' variable by 4 to calculate the number of dog years for my human late years
 var laterYears = 44;

 laterYears *= 4;
console.log(laterYears);

// Step 6 : console log earlyYears and laterYears: completed above

// Step 7: Added earlyYears and lateYears to calculate total dog years

var MyAgeInDogYears = 21+ 176;
console.log(MyAgeInDogYears);

//Step 8: Used toLowercase() method to achieve an output with all lower case letters

var myName = 'ANA';
console.log('ANA'.toLowerCase());

// Step 9: Used string interpolation to change origonal string : My name is NAME. I am Human Age years old in human years which is DOG AGE years old in dog years

var myName = 'Ana';
var myAge= 46;
var myAgeInDogYears = 197;
console.log(`My name is ${myName}. I am ${myAge} years old in human years which is ${myAgeInDogYears} years old in dog years.`);
